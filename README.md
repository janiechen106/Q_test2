Flight Data Coding Assignment - Quantexa

# How to run

The answers for the 4 (+1) questions are in src/main/scala/Main.scala file. So please run this file to generate the CSV files. 
The input datasets are in src/main/scala/resources, the same as the output CSVs.

For the extra question, you may want to edit the N flights, from and to dates - please go to line 81 to make the changes. 

For any questions, please feel free to reach out to the author, Janie Chen at janiechen1006@gmail.com
